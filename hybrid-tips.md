# Tips for Operating in a Hybrid In-person/Virtual Environment

This course will be explicitly and intentionally hybrid. This means that we are all going to have to work together to ensure parity as much as possible in the in-person and virtual experiences. Additionally, one of the in-person class participants will act as the "Assistant Facilitator" each lecture session to ensure that someone is keeping an eye on the virtual experience.

## How to participate virtually

* Find somewhere comfortable and free from significant distraction
* Mute your microphone unless you are speaking
* If you have a question, use the "Raise Hand" feature
* Know who the assistant-facilitator is, in case you need an in-person avatar

## How to participate in person

* Join the virtual room with your phone or computer
* Mute sound output
* Mute your microphone unless you are speaking
* If you are speaking, unmute your microphone so that everyone can hear you well, both in the classroom and online
* Don't talk over others (really, you shouldn't do this anyway :shrug:)

## How to be an assistant-facilitator

* Join the virtual room, as above
* Keep an eye on the chat and the raised hands
* At the soonest convenient moment, let the presenter know about the message or the raised hand
