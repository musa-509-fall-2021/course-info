# MUSA 509: Geospatial Cloud Computing & Visualization

**Instructor:** Mjumbe Poe, mjumbe@design.upenn.edu  
**Schedule:** Mondays & Wednesdays, 3:30-5  
**Room:** Graduate Education Building, 114  

## Course Description

This course is designed to provide students with the skills to build cloud-based data pipelines, and provide answers to operational questions using spatial data analytics and visualizations. There will be a strong emphasis on open source tools although we will also strongly rely on proprietary cloud-based infrastructure providers.

Besides the technologies used in class, we will be using large and sometimes messy data from which we will be deriving insights from how people inhabit, move around in, and affect their environments. We will be working with datasets published by a variety of organizations, from the local to the national level, across governments, non-profits, and private corporations.

The class is divided into four modules:

1. **Spatial Analytics with Databases** -- learn the basics of SQL and PostGIS for exploring datasets and answering questions of your data
2. **Python and SQL** -- building basic scripts with queries and interacting with web services/APIs programmatically
3. **Data Pipelining** -- use Python and SQL to automate extracting, transforming, and loading data into a data warehouse
4. **Building Dashboards** -- build a dashboard to answer operational questions using visualizations of dynamic data

## Course Objectives

Students will learn how to use professional tools and cloud-based services to automate the process of preparing data for use in organizational decision making. **By the end of this course students should be able to:**
* Use SQL to answer questions with the data in a database
* Set up and use tools for exploring and visualizing data in a database
* Use web services to create beautiful and meaningful maps from data
* Use Python to automate the process of extracting, transforming, and loading data
* Do all of these things using professional software development tools and methods

## Format

* The course will be divided between lectures on Mondays and labs on Wednesdays.
* Lab sessions will be interactive, usually with some deliverable expected by the end that will make up part of the participation portion of a student's grade.
* Students will have the option of attending the lecture and lab sessions in person in the classroom, or virtually through Zoom.

## Assignments

There will be assignments with some lectures. Other lectures will have recommended readings and suggested exercises to give additional practice. Labs will often have exercises that are intended to be completed in class or, in some exceptional cases, soon after.

The final project will be the culmination of all of the skills learned in the class. Students will build an automatically updating dashboard, powered by a cloud-hosted data pipeline, that can be used to make some operational decisions. Expectations are that the dashboards will address some socially relevant domain, and will make use of multiple visualizations of data (static or interactive charts and maps, formatted statistics, templated prose, etc.).

## Grading

* Homeworks: 25%
* Participation: 25%
* Final Project Proposal: 10%
* Final Project: 40%

## Course Data

Some of the data we are using in this course is proprietary and cannot be openly disseminated. Students will be provided with access to our private class repository of datasets. Derivative insights based on these datasets can be openly shared, especially as part of final project work.

## Academic Integrity

Students are expected to comply with and be familiar with [Penn's Code of Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity).

When writing software, it is common to copy and paste small code snippets from online sources without citation. For larger samples, it is expected that the source is cited in the code base. In case there is uncertainty, speak with your instructor for guidance.
